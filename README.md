# Password-Generator

## Introduction

Thank you for visiting my repo, used for storing and deploying my password generator web application using newly learned JavaScript. I created this application for an employee upon request, as they had access to private and sensitive information and needed to quickly generate and use strong and unique passwords to secure said information.I found this task to be equal parts challenging and intuitive, and all parts fun!

## Instructions

1. Load the page or the index.html file.
2. Follow the prompts carefully.
3. Once you find a password that you like, use Copy/Paste to use it in your required area.
4. Don't forget to save the password somewhere safe. An encrypted password manager is recommended.
5. If you have any issues, try starting from the beginning.

## Password Characteristics

1. Password will be between 8 and 128 characters long.
2. It can contain uppercase letter, numbers and only the following special characters (!,@,#,$,%).
3. Spaces are not allowed.
